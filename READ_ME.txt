Here I have given the exe file of my Social Networking App (Facebook) project  with some graphics.
You can run it .
At this time this application contain following  features:
    Login Page
-  You have to enter user id ( as given in the txt files i.e u1,u2,u7 etc) and then click on login to login to app.   //Here I have implemented the setCurrentUser 
-  If you enter wrong id or if user does not exist against the id then it will give you an error message
-  So when you enter the write id according to given txt files it will login you to the app

   Main Page
  Main Page contains all the features of that app
1. First of All you will see UserName of that current user that you have login
2. Then left and right side of the app shows you the friends List and Liked pages Lists of that current user.  
3. In the center of the app you will see the timeline of the current user which includes :
- Name of user that have shared that post
- Date of Post share
- If post have activity than you will see Activity with an acitivity logo first and then the Text of the Post
- No of likes on that post
- Comments and no of commnets on that post   IF you want to see mall comments than you have to click on comments.
- Button to Add Comment ( Not working at this time but later i will add that funcitonality)
- Like Button          (Button is Out of order right now )

And you can see almost all post in user Timeline (Still working on that also)

4. Search App (where you will search any page ,user, post by ID)   (This feature will also be availabe in future)
5. HomePage shows the recent post shared in 24 hours by user's Friends or liked pages.
6. Memories shows the post shared in timeline on the same date but years ago.
7. Also one can add friends and share post and much more so wait for it.
                                                 *-*  End of Features   *-*
